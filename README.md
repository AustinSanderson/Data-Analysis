Sample Population

Our data set is aggregated based on Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) facilities. CoC facilities provide homeless services to regions that contain one or more counties. There are CoCs that are Statewide and CoCs  for a Balance of State (BoS). Any/all BoS CoCs and statewide CoCs have been removed from the data set as they will not include county-level data for comparison with the independent and control variables. States which have a only a statewide CoC are: Delaware, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Wyoming. Aggregating only the CoCs providing services at a county level, our sample population will include 329 CoCs, from 44 states, composed of ~758 counties, and ~258 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

County-level data (aggregated at the CoC Level)

All counties included in each continuum of care (CoC) area contain variables for which the mean, median, or sum is computed. As some Census population data was not available for all years of our data set, total county populations have been imputed using a mean. As such, the population density is based off of the imputed population mean data values. All population variables have been recoded to per 10,000 residents based on the summed county populations of the greater CoC region to per 10,000 residents.

#Additional breakdown on the homeless subpopulations is forthcoming

Data on homelessness is collected from Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) facilities for the time period between 2007 and 2018.  CoC facilities are in city-county regions of the country for the purpose of providing homeless services. These services include, but are not limited to, allocating funds and resources for emergency shelters, transitional housing, and non-profits serving the homeless.   

#Additional breakdown on the jail/prison populations is forthcoming

Incarceration

Data on incarceration is from the Vera Institute of Justice. For the purposes of this analysis, we are using data from 2007 â€“ 2018 because data from CoCs is not available prior to 2007. For jail populations, time-series data is available between 2007 and 2018. For prison populations, data is available between 1970 and 2016. Vera aggregated this time-series data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ), and the Census of Jails (COJ).

Cannabis Policy

Drug enforcement policy data is collected from official state legislature websites. All variables for recreational and medicinal cannabis policy is coded yes or no by year. Note that states with only CBD as medically legal, or CBD with trace amounts of THC only, are not included as affirmatively allowing medicinal treatments. The reason is because these medical treatments contain negligible amounts of psychoactive components; this study is to predict the effects of legalization on homelessness stemming from addictive use of psychoactive drugs. CBD is not considered an addictive substance, so it is not included as "medical cannabis" for the purposes of this study. Additionally, states such as Utah which do have some medical cannabis legislation are restricted so as to extremely limit availability to anyone without some terminal condition, so this will not be considered a "medically legal" territory for our study. Other states, such as Virginia, only expanded their medical cannabis laws to allow for access to anyone a doctor deemed it beneficial to, though their medical cannabis program had existed for years. As such, our data set will indicate Virginia only as having medical cannabis starting in 2018.
